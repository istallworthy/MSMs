We suggest staying consistent with any customization throughout use of package workflow. We recommend being sure to include all measured confounders (and no mediators or colliders) for each exposure time point in the weights formulas. Please refer to the accompanying manuscript for more details.  \n\nBelow, we illustrate the customization options for each of the three modes of the `createFormuls()` function using information from the package dataset as an example. These data are simulated based on data from the Family Life Project (FLP), a longitudinal study following 1,292 families representative of two geographic areas (three counties in North Carolina and three counties in Pennsylvania) with high rural child poverty (Vernon-Feagans et al., 2013; Burchinal et al., 2008). We take the example exposure of economic strain (ESETA1) measured at 6, 15, 24, 35, and 58 months in relation to the outcome of behavior problems (StrDif_Tot) measured at 58 months. \n  \n<br> \n\n## Customize Full Weights Formulas (Steps 1 & 4)\nThe default use of `createFormulas()` with `type` = \"full\" creates weights formulas at each exposure time point. Each formula contains all time invariant confounders as well as all time-varying confounders measured at time points prior to that exposure time point. For example, for the 24-month weights formula, we would have time-varying confounders only at 6 and 15 months.  \n\n### Time-Varying Confounders Measured Contemporaneously With Exposure Time Point\nHowever, if users wish to also include any time-varying confounders measured contemporaneously with the exposure time point (e.g., also include 24-month time-varying confounders in the 24-month weights formula), they can specify those time-varying confounders in the optional argument to `initMSM()`, `concur_conf`.   \n  \nFor example, to include 24-month maternal depression in the 24-month weights formula, we do the following:\n\nWe first specify confounders to retain contemporaneously when creating our MSM object. \n```{r}\n\nobj <- devMSMs::initMSM(\n  data = sim_data_wide, \n  exposure = exposure, \n  tv_conf = tv_conf, \n  ti_conf = ti_conf,\n  concur_conf = \"B18Raw.24\"\n)\n\n```\n\n\n```{r}\nfull_formulas <- createFormulas(obj  = obj, \n                                type = \"full\")\n\nprint(full_formulas)\n```\n\nNow `B18Raw.24` is included in the 24-month weights formula in addition to the 35-and 58-month formulas.  \n\n### Fully Custom Formulas\nAlternatively, a user could completely customize the full formulas by manually creating formulas for each exposure time point using the optional `custom` argument. \n  \nTo create custom formulas, the user creates a list with an entry for each exposure time point, each of which contains the weights formula for exposure at that time point. `createFormulas()` will conduct checks to ensure there is a formula for each time point and provides cautionary warnings for unusual variables (e.g., those measured after the exposure time point). However, the user is responsible for ensuring the validity of these formulas. \n\nOf note, if the user creates a custom \"full\" formula, they will also have to create custom formulas when using `createFormulas()` to make \"short\" and \"updated\" formulas. \n  \nBelow, we illustrate an abridged example for specifying the `custom` arguments for the exposure, ESETA1, at 6-, 15-, 24-, 35-, and 58-month time points.   \n```{r}\ncustom <- list(\n  ESETA1.6 ~ BioDadInHH2 + DrnkFreq + gov_assist,\n  ESETA1.15 ~ BioDadInHH2 + DrnkFreq + gov_assist,\n  ESETA1.24 ~ BioDadInHH2 + DrnkFreq + gov_assist,\n  ESETA1.35 ~ BioDadInHH2 + DrnkFreq + gov_assist,\n  ESETA1.58 ~ BioDadInHH2 + DrnkFreq + gov_assist\n)\n```\n  \n`customFormulas()` then checks and retains these formulas for further use with the package.  \n\n```{r}\nfull_formulas <- createFormulas(obj = obj, \n                                custom = custom)\n\nprint(full_formulas)\n```\n\n<br>\n\n## Customize Short Weights Formulas (Step 2)\nThe default use of `createFormulas()` with `type` = \"short\" creates shortened weights formulas at each exposure time point. Each formula contains all time invariant confounders as well as only those time-varying confounders measured at the time point directly prior (*t*-1 lag) to that exposure time point. For example, for the 24-month weights formula, we would only include time-varying confounders at 15 months. Please see the *Workflows* vignettes and accompanying manuscript for more detail. \n  \nWhen creating short formulas, the user can specify the optional `concur_conf` and `custom` arguments detailed above. Of note, `createFormulas()` does not check that formulas in the `custom` field meet criteria for the shortened formula, and thus the user is responsible for ensuring the validity of these formulas.  \n  \nWhen creating short formulas, the user can also specify an optional `keep_conf` argument. Users would specify this second argument with any time-varying confounders to always retain in the formulas, in lagged form, overriding the *t*-1 lag default. Users may wish to use this argument if they have time-varying confounders that are not highly consistent over time and have strong reasons to include them in the initial phase of selecting the optimal weighting method (see *Workflows* vignettes for more details). Note that unless these variables are also specified in `concuf_conf`, they will only be retained in lagged form. \n  \nFor example, to always retain income in all formulas in lagged form, overriding the *t*-1 lag default via `keep_conf`.\n\nAs shown below, the `createFormulas` function now retains income at 6 months in all 15-, 24-, 35-, and 58-month formulas, overriding the *t*-1 lag rule for that variable. Without this specification, income at 6 months would have been omitted in formulas for exposure at 24, 35, and 58 months.  \n```{r}\nshort_formulas <- createFormulas(obj = obj, \n                                 type = \"short\", \n                                 keep_conf = c(\"InRatioCor.6\"))\nprint(short_formulas)\n```\n<br>\n\n\n### Customize Updated Weights Formulas (Step 3)\nThe default use of `createFormulas()` with `type` = \"update\" creates updated weights formulas at each exposure time point. Each formula contains all time invariant confounders; time-varying confounders measured at the time point directly prior (*t*-1 lag) to that exposure time point; as well as any time-varying confounders at greater lags that were not successfully balanced using the short weights formulas.  \n\nWhen creating updated formulas, the user can specify the optional `concur_conf`, `keep_conf`, and `custom` arguments detailed above. Of note, `createFormulas()` does not check that formulas in the `custom` field meet criteria for the updated formula or identify any imbalanced confounders, and the user is responsible for ensuring the validity of these formulas. \n<br>\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r, include = FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(\n  collapse = TRUE,\n  comment = \"#>\"\n)\n```\n\nThis vignette provides guidance on how to customize weights formulas for use in *devMSMs*.

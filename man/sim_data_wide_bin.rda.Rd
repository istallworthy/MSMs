\title{Wide complete data (binary exposure)
These data are simulated based on data from the Family Life Project (FLP), a longitudinal study following 1,292 families
representative of two geographic areas (three counties in North Carolina and three counties in Pennsylvania) with high rural
child poverty (Vernon-Feagans et al., 2013; Burchinal et al., 2008).
These data contain economic strain (ESEATA1) as a binary variable, and have no missing data.}

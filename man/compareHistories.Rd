\title{Compare exposure histories
This code uses the best-fitting model for each exposure-outcome pair to compare the effects of user-specified reference and comparison histories of exposure on outcome u sing linear hypothesis testing}

compareHistories(object, data_for_model_with_weights_cutoff, all_models)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{msm object that contains all relevant user inputs}

\item{data_for_model_with_weights_cutoff}{imputed datasets with truncated weights}

\item{all_models}{fitted models for each imputed dataset}

\item{reference}{optional reference event for custom comparison}

\item{compare}{optional coparison event(s) for custom comparison}

\description{
These data are simulated based on data from the Family Life Project (FLP), a longitudinal study following 1,292 families
representative of two geographic areas (three counties in North Carolina and three counties in Pennsylvania) with high rural
child poverty (Vernon-Feagans et al., 2013; Burchinal et al., 2008). MAR missingness has been added using the missMethods package.
These data contain economic strain (ESEATA1) as a continuously distributed variable.

# devMSMs

`devMSMs` is an R package for implementing marginal structural models with longitudinal data to answer causal questions in developmental science. This package has an accompanying tutorial paper, Investigating Causal Questions in Human Development using Marginal Structural Models: A Tutorial Introduction to the devMSMs Package in R, that is forthcoming. 

Core features of this package include: 
- step-by-step user guidance for users new to the MSM technique and R programming
- flexible functions for implementing IPTW weighting and outcome modeling to answer substantive causal questions about dose and timing
